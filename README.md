# FEMUnitConsistency (in development)

GOAL:
Develop a user-friendly code to provide and ensure consistent engineering units ("coherent units") in Finite Element Analysis (FEA).

DESCRIPTION:
Most FEA analysts prefer to work within their chosen set of consistent units, such as [N, m, kg, s, K], [N, mm, T, s, K], or [Lbf, in, slug, s, Â°F]. However, there are cases where it's necessary to change one or more of these basic units. In such instances, it's crucial to use consistent derived units throughout the FEA model to ensure accuracy and coherence.
